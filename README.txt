This is the Team Fortress 2 Gamemode for Garry's Mod 13. Thank you so much for taking interest in this!

The gamemode is stable for use, but many bugs are still there. I am not a super-excellent LUA coder myself (mostly chicken scratch), but it would be nice to find what other issues are present besides the one I found on my free time. Many items/weapons/miscs are outdated, at the moment I'm not worried about implementing new things, or current changes, I care about getting the base gamemode stable. :-)

This gamemode is free and open source under GPL Version 3.0 License. THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED AS IS, NO WARRANTIES, VERY LIMITED HELP/SUPPORT, AND A NOVICE LUA CODER.

***Report any bugs to the "Issues" tab. Although I may/may not be able to fix them (because of my LUA skill), it helps me a lot when I do get to the big squashing process (usually my free time).***
